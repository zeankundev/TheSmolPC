This is my journal of the design and building process of **The Smol PC**.  
You can view this journal in more detail on **Hack Club Blueprint** [here](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/projects/305).


## 10/8/2025 - Started the project!  

Started the KiCad project as well as writing a bit of README on how the project should go, such as what things should I consider in my head, as well as a bit of AI consultation just to know what could be added to further improve the experience of a PC-like one.
