## 10/8/2025 - Started the project!  

Started the KiCad project as well as writing a bit of README on how the project should go, such as what things should I consider in my head, as well as a bit of AI consultation just to know what could be added to further improve the experience of a PC-like one.

## 10/16/2025 3 PM - More setup on the project  

I did set up lots of things in things ahead of the project, such as the main brains called the RP2350B and a lot of salvaging from a random GitHub repo to just be able to fetch those footprints I needed for this project that I will be doing, so expect more updates!

## 10/16/2025 4 PM - Made the block diagram in Figma  

Of course, great ideas doesn't exist without a plan constructing what to be expected later on. Everyone has a plan, so I made the block diagram for the thingy, which will illustrate how will my architecture go, so it's better for all to just understand under the hood

## 10/18/2025 - Partially completed the schematic  

I made the schematic per the block diagram I have designed, now I am still consulting regarding the HSTX out for video output whether if I did it correctly, but some parts of the schematic is finished, just need for one to assist me and I can continue the rest. So yeah, expect more to come.
