# The Smol PC
An obscure, RP2350B-based computer motherboard on a smol form factor that you will think it's cute. And another absurd project I'm working on

## Features
- [ ] USB 1.1 with both power & data, up to 2x USB-A ports and 1x USB-C port, HID-compliant
- [ ] SD Card as storage medium
- [ ] HDMI/DVI video output
- [ ] Big amount of flash and PSRAM (flash will be around 16MB) for a microcontroller
- [ ] I2S/PCM audio output via a standard 3.5mm jack
- [ ] **Out of the box firmware boot** - this means that you can run any UEFI-like firmware for any OS you want to run, or you can use a stock firmware, or flash a generic firmware as if you were flashing on a normal RP2350
- [ ] Debug Probe-compatible debug ports (Raspberry Pi Debug Probe)
- [ ] Built-in WiFi support (ESP32-C3)
