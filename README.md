# The Smol PC
An obscure, RP2350B-based computer motherboard on a smol form factor that you will think it's cute. And another absurd project I'm working on.

In essence, it's basically Adafruit's Fruit Jam but better and improved (fixes major issues lol, adafruit pls fix ur routing)

## Features
- [x] USB 1.1 with both power & data, up to 2x USB-A ports and 1x USB-C port, HID-compliant
- [x] SD Card as storage medium
- [x] HDMI/DVI video output
- [x] Big amount of flash and PSRAM (flash will be around 16MB) for a microcontroller
- [x] I2S/PCM audio output via a standard 3.5mm jack
- [ ] **Out of the box firmware boot** - this means that you can run any UEFI-like firmware for any OS you want to run, or you can use a stock firmware, or flash a generic firmware as if you were flashing on a normal RP2350 (maybe ?)
- [x] Debug Probe-compatible debug ports (Raspberry Pi Debug Probe)
- [x] Built-in WiFi support (ESP32-C3)
